# create a web server to keep a list of books
# when we call POST we can add a book to the list, we specify the name & how many pages it has
# when we call DELETE we just specify the name & remove the book from a list
# we can record our reading progress, how many pages we read, we use PUT and specify the name of the book and
# how many pages we read since our last input (we need to keep a value of pages_read and add to it the new number)
# GET returns a list of the book names & the percentage of how much we read
